Public, lightweight curricula you can follow with an **AI Teacher**. Each guide is hands-on, split into short phases, and uses plain-language prompts and small activities (no code required in activities).

## How to use
1. Pick a curriculum in `curricula/<topic>/`.
2. Read the **Overview** and **Learning Outcomes**.
3. For each phase: ask the AI Teacher the listed questions, complete the small activity, and write a brief reflection.
4. Share your progress (blog/LinkedIn) using the included `companion-post.md` as a starting point.
