> **Beginner-friendly** • **5 phases** • **20-30 minutes each** • **No coding required**

Master Infrastructure as Code fundamentals on Google Cloud Platform through structured, interactive learning with your AI Teacher.

## What You'll Learn

- **Explain** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts and benefits in Google Cloud Platform
- **Identify** and describe core GCP building blocks including Projects, IAM, VPC, Compute, and Storage services
- **Compare** Deployment Manager and Terraform for GCP infrastructure automation
- **Design** an automated CI/CD workflow using Google Cloud Build for infrastructure deployment
- **Create** a comprehensive deployment plan for a small, production-ready GCP environment

## Learning Path Structure

### Phase 1 — Understanding Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals

**Goal:** Understand what Infrastructure as Code means and why it's valuable for cloud deployments.
**Time:** 25 minutes

### Phase 2 — Exploring GCP Core Building Blocks

**Goal:** Identify and understand the fundamental GCP services that form the foundation of most cloud architectures.
**Time:** 25 minutes

### Phase 3 — Comparing IaC Tools: Deployment Manager vs Terraform

**Goal:** Understand the strengths and use cases of GCP's native Deployment Manager versus the popular third-party tool Terraform.
**Time:** 25-30 minutes

### Phase 4 — Building Automated Workflows with Cloud Build

**Goal:** Design CI/CD pipelines that automatically deploy infrastructure changes using Cloud Build.
**Time:** 25 minutes

### Phase 5 — Designing Production-Ready Deployment Strategies
