# Learning GCP Infrastructure as Code — Companion Checklist

_Quick prompts to keep you moving. Pair with the **Core Curriculum**._

**How to use:** For each phase, ask 1–2 prompts, do the activity (describe/plan, no code), then capture a 3‑bullet reflection.

---

## Phase 1 — Understanding Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals

- **Ask:** "What are the main benefits of using Infrastructure as Code compared to manual cloud resource management?"
- **Activity:** Create a comparison table listing 5 manual infrastructure management tasks versus their IaC equivalents
- **Reflect:** What manual infrastructure tasks could benefit most from automation?

## Phase 2 — Exploring GCP Core Building Blocks

- **Ask:** "How do GCP Projects, folders, and organizations work together to structure cloud resources?"
- **Activity:** Design a simple three-tier web application architecture on GCP with appropriate services
- **Reflect:** Which GCP building block seems most complex and needs more learning?

## Phase 3 — Comparing IaC Tools: Deployment Manager vs Terraform

- **Ask:** "What are the key advantages of using Deployment Manager for GCP-only infrastructure?"
- **Activity:** Create a decision matrix comparing Deployment Manager and Terraform across 6 factors
- **Reflect:** Which tool would you recommend for your team and why?

## Phase 4 — Building Automated Workflows with Cloud Build

- **Ask:** "How would you set up a Cloud Build pipeline that requires manual approval before deploying to production?"
- **Activity:** Design a complete CI/CD workflow for infrastructure deployment with approval gates
- **Reflect:** What risks do you see with automated infrastructure deployment and how to mitigate them?

## Phase 5 — Designing Production-Ready Deployment Strategies

- **Ask:** "What are the essential components of a production-ready GCP architecture for a web application?"
- **Activity:** Create a production readiness checklist prioritized by importance
- **Reflect:** What aspect of production infrastructure deployment concerns you most?

## Capstone Options

- **Option 1:** Infrastructure blueprint for three-tier web application with detailed deployment planning
- **Option 2:** Migration strategy document from manual to automated IaC workflows
- **Option 3:** Production readiness checklist and deployment timeline for startup infrastructure

**Deliverables:** 1-2 page write-up with architecture diagram, GCP services list with justifications, 3 key lessons learned.
