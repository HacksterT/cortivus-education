# Learning Model Context Protocols Fundamentals — Companion Checklist
_Quick prompts to keep you moving. Pair with the **Core Curriculum**._

**How to use:** For each phase, ask 1–2 prompts, do the activity (describe/plan, no code), then capture a 3‑bullet reflection.

---

## Phase 1 — Understanding What MCPs Are and Why They Matter
- **Ask:** "What specific problems do Model Context Protocols solve that traditional AI architectures struggle with?"
- **Activity:** Create a problem-solution mapping table with 5 AI development challenges and MCP solutions
- **Reflect:** What aspect of AI system development would most benefit from better context management?

## Phase 2 — Exploring MCP Architecture and Core Components
- **Ask:** "How do the different MCP components work together to maintain context consistency?"
- **Activity:** Design a high-level architecture diagram for an MCP-based customer service chatbot
- **Reflect:** Which MCP architectural component seems most complex to implement?

## Phase 3 — Managing Context in AI Workflows
- **Ask:** "How do MCPs decide what context information is relevant for a specific AI interaction?"
- **Activity:** Create a context management strategy for a multi-step AI workflow (loan application processing)
- **Reflect:** What challenges do you foresee in maintaining accurate context in complex AI systems?

## Phase 4 — Tracing Communication Flow and Data Movement
- **Ask:** "How do MCPs ensure that context information reaches the right AI components at the right time?"
- **Activity:** Trace complete communication flow for complex AI interaction with external API calls
- **Reflect:** What aspect of MCP communication flow would be most challenging to debug?

## Phase 5 — Designing MCP Implementation Strategies
- **Ask:** "What factors should guide the decision between building custom MCP components versus using existing frameworks?"
- **Activity:** Develop an MCP implementation roadmap for a specific use case with phases and timeline
- **Reflect:** What aspect of MCP implementation would require the most learning for your team?

**Capstone Options**
- **Option 1:** MCP architecture design for chatbot with context flow and component interactions
- **Option 2:** Comparison analysis of MCP-based versus traditional AI system architectures
- **Option 3:** Implementation roadmap for migrating existing AI application to MCPs

**Deliverables:** 1-2 page write-up with architecture diagram, MCP components list with justifications, 3 key lessons learned.
