# Learning Model Context Protocols Fundamentals â€” What I'm Learning This Month

This month I'm exploring Model Context Protocols (MCPs) - the emerging standard for managing context in AI applications! This beginner-friendly learning path takes you from understanding what MCPs are to designing implementation strategies for real-world AI systems. You'll dive into MCP architecture, context management techniques, communication flows, and practical implementation approaches. Perfect for AI developers and engineers who want to build more sophisticated, context-aware AI applications.

**Highlights**
- 5 progressive phases covering MCP fundamentals, architecture, and implementation strategies
- Designed for beginners with basic AI and software architecture knowledge
- Hands-on activities focused on design and planning (no coding required)
- Three capstone project options to apply your MCP knowledge
- AI Teacher prompts to guide your learning journey through complex concepts
