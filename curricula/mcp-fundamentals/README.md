## Learning Model Context Protocols Fundamentals — Learning Path

This folder gives you a **three-layer learning experience** guided by an **AI Teacher**:

- **Layer 1 — Orientation (this page):** What you'll learn and how to navigate
- **Layer 2 — Core Curriculum:** Step‑by‑step phases with prompts and activities
- **Layer 3 — Companion Checklist:** One‑page quick prompts

## Learning Outcomes

By the end, you will be able to:

- Define Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and explain their purpose in AI system architecture
- Identify and describe the key architectural components and building blocks of MCPs
- Explain how MCPs handle and maintain context throughout AI workflows and interactions
- Trace the communication flow of data and instructions through MCP-based systems
- Design a basic MCP implementation plan for a simple AI application use case

## How to use this path

1. Open **[Core Curriculum](./curriculum.md)** and complete Phases 1–5 in 20–30 minute sessions.
2. Keep **[Companion Checklist](./companion-checklist.md)** open for quick prompts.
3. After each phase, use the reflection questions to assess your understanding.

**Start here →** [Core Curriculum](./curriculum.md) • [Companion Checklist](./companion-checklist.md)
