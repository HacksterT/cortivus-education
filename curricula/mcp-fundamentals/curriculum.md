## Overview

This curriculum teaches Model Context Protocols fundamentals, covering what MCPs are, their architecture, context management, communication flows, and implementation strategies for beginners.

## Learning Outcomes

- Define Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and explain their purpose in AI system architecture
- Identify and describe the key architectural components and building blocks of MCPs
- Explain how MCPs handle and maintain context throughout AI workflows and interactions
- Trace the communication flow of data and instructions through MCP-based systems
- Design a basic MCP implementation plan for a simple AI application use case

---

## Phase 1 — Understanding What MCPs Are and Why They Matter

**Estimated time:** 25 minutes  
**Goal:** Understand the fundamental concept of Model Context Protocols and their importance in AI systems.

### Phase 1 Core Ideas

- Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are standardized frameworks for managing context in AI applications
- MCPs solve the challenge of maintaining coherent, relevant context across AI interactions
- They enable better AI performance by providing structured ways to handle information flow
- MCPs facilitate integration between different AI models and external systems
- They address scalability and consistency issues in complex AI workflows

### Phase 1 Ask the AI Teacher

- "What specific problems do Model Context Protocols solve that traditional AI architectures struggle with?"
- "Can you explain how MCPs differ from regular APIs or communication protocols?"
- "What are some real-world examples where MCPs would be particularly beneficial?"

### Phase 1 Activity (no code)

Create a problem-solution mapping table. List 5 common challenges in AI system development and explain how MCPs could address each challenge. Include specific benefits for each solution.

### Phase 1 Reflect

What aspect of AI system development in your experience would most benefit from better context management?

## Phase 2 — Exploring MCP Architecture and Core Components

**Estimated time:** 25 minutes  
**Goal:** Identify and understand the key architectural components that make up MCP systems.

### Phase 2 Core Ideas

- MCP architecture includes context stores, protocol handlers, and communication interfaces
- Context stores maintain persistent and session-based information across interactions
- Protocol handlers manage the rules and logic for context processing and routing
- Communication interfaces enable integration with AI models, databases, and external services
- Component orchestration ensures smooth data flow and system coordination

### Phase 2 Ask the AI Teacher

- "How do the different MCP components work together to maintain context consistency?"
- "What's the difference between persistent and session-based context in MCP architecture?"
- "How does MCP architecture handle scaling when dealing with multiple concurrent AI interactions?"

### Phase 2 Activity (no code)

Design a high-level architecture diagram for an MCP-based customer service chatbot. Identify the key components needed and describe how they would interact to maintain conversation context across multiple customer touchpoints.

### Phase 2 Reflect

Which MCP architectural component seems most complex to implement, and what would you need to understand better about it?

## Phase 3 — Managing Context in AI Workflows

**Estimated time:** 25–30 minutes  
**Goal:** Understand how MCPs handle and maintain context throughout complex AI workflows.

### Phase 3 Core Ideas

- Context management involves capturing, storing, retrieving, and updating relevant information
- MCPs use context hierarchies to organize information by relevance and scope
- Context lifecycle management ensures information is available when needed and cleaned up appropriately
- Context sharing mechanisms enable multiple AI components to access relevant information
- Context validation ensures data integrity and prevents context pollution

### Phase 3 Ask the AI Teacher

- "How do MCPs decide what context information is relevant for a specific AI interaction?"
- "What strategies do MCPs use to prevent context from becoming outdated or irrelevant?"
- "How do MCPs handle conflicting context information from different sources?"

### Phase 3 Activity (no code)

Create a context management strategy for a multi-step AI workflow (like processing a loan application). Map out what context needs to be captured at each step, how long it should be retained, and which components need access to it.

### Phase 3 Reflect

What challenges do you foresee in maintaining accurate and relevant context in a complex AI system?

## Phase 4 — Tracing Communication Flow and Data Movement

**Estimated time:** 25 minutes  
**Goal:** Understand how data and instructions flow through MCP-based systems.

### Phase 4 Core Ideas

- Communication flow follows defined protocols for request routing and response handling
- Data movement includes context propagation, transformation, and synchronization
- Message queuing and event-driven architectures support asynchronous communication
- Error handling and retry mechanisms ensure reliable data transmission
- Monitoring and logging provide visibility into communication patterns and performance

### Phase 4 Ask the AI Teacher

- "How do MCPs ensure that context information reaches the right AI components at the right time?"
- "What happens when communication fails between MCP components, and how is it handled?"
- "How do MCPs handle data transformation when different components expect different formats?"

### Phase 4 Activity (no code)

Trace the complete communication flow for a complex AI interaction (like a multi-turn conversation with external API calls). Document each step, what data moves where, and identify potential failure points and recovery strategies.

### Phase 4 Reflect

What aspect of MCP communication flow would be most challenging to debug when things go wrong?

## Phase 5 — Designing MCP Implementation Strategies

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes  
**Goal:** Plan practical approaches for implementing MCPs in real-world AI applications.

### Phase 5 Core Ideas

- Implementation strategy depends on application requirements, scale, and existing architecture
- Gradual migration approaches minimize risk when adopting MCPs in existing systems
- Technology stack selection impacts performance, maintainability, and integration capabilities
- Testing strategies must account for context consistency and communication reliability
- Monitoring and observability are crucial for maintaining MCP system health

### Phase 5 Ask the AI Teacher

- "What factors should guide the decision between building custom MCP components versus using existing frameworks?"
- "How would you approach migrating an existing AI application to use Model Context Protocols?"
- "What are the key metrics to monitor in an MCP-based system to ensure optimal performance?"

### Phase 5 Activity (no code)

Develop an MCP implementation roadmap for a specific use case (choose: e-commerce recommendation system, content moderation platform, or educational AI tutor). Include phases, timeline, resource requirements, and success criteria.

### Phase 5 Reflect

What aspect of MCP implementation would require the most learning and preparation for your team?
