PHASE 1: CURRICULUM PLANNING & STRUCTURE
Using the provided title and slug, create the remaining foundational elements that will work with the template structure:

**GIVEN INFORMATION:**
- **Topic Title**: Learning GCP Infrastructure as Code
- **Slug**: gcp-iac-fundamentals

**CREATE THESE ELEMENTS:**
1. **Learning Outcomes**: Develop 5 specific, measurable outcomes that learners can achieve
2. **Phase Titles**: Design 5 progressive phase titles that build logically (20-30 min each)
3. **Tags**: Choose 4-6 relevant tags (e.g., gcp, iac, cloud, terraform, beginner)
4. **Target Audience**: Define who this is for based on beginner level
5. **Capstone Options**: Suggest 2-3 hands-on project options (NO CODE required)

IMPORTANT PHASE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
Each phase must include:
- **Goal**: What success looks like for that phase
- **Core Ideas**: 3-5 bullet points of key concepts
- **Ask the AI Teacher**: 2-3 natural language prompts for learners to ask
- **Activity**: Hands-on task (planning/describing, NO CODE)
- **Reflect**: 1 question for self-assessment

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR PHASE 1:
```

- [Specific, measurable outcome 4]
- [Specific, measurable outcome 5]

**Phase Progression:**
1. Phase 1 — [Foundation/Basics title]
2. Phase 2 — [Building on Phase 1]
3. Phase 3 — [Intermediate concepts]
4. Phase 4 — [Advanced application]

- Option 1: [Hands-on project description - no code]
- Option 2: [Alternative project description - no code]
- Option 3: [Third option description - no code]
```

EXPERTISE LEVEL GUIDANCE:
- **Beginner**: Start with fundamentals, use simple language, provide more context, assume no prior knowledge
- **Intermediate**: Assume basic knowledge, focus on practical application, bridge theory to practice
- **Advanced**: Dive deeper into complex concepts, assume strong foundation, focus on optimization and best practices

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Learning outcomes must be specific and measurable (use action verbs)
- Phase titles should build progressively and logically
- Each phase should take 20-30 minutes to complete
- Capstone projects should synthesize knowledge from all phases
- Content appropriate for beginner level learners
- Activities must contain NO CODE - only descriptions, planning, or conceptual tasks
- All phases should include meaningful reflection questions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 2: CREATE CURRICULUM FILES
Using the approved structure from Phase 1, create the three main curriculum files using the templates as your foundation.

REFERENCE THE APPROVED STRUCTURE from Phase 1 and use these templates:
- Landing Page Template: C:\Projects\cortivus-education\cortivus-education-templates\LANDING_README_TEMPLATE.md
- Core Curriculum Template: C:\Projects\cortivus-education\cortivus-education-templates\CURRICULUM_TEMPLATE.md  
- Companion Checklist Template: C:\Projects\cortivus-education\cortivus-education-templates\COMPANION_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md

CREATE THESE FILES (output as separate markdown code blocks):

1) **PATH: curricula/gcp-iac-fundamentals/README.md** (Landing Page)
   - Use LANDING_README_TEMPLATE.md as foundation
   - Replace all placeholders with your generated content from Phase 1
   - Title should be: "Learning GCP Infrastructure as Code — Learning Path (Landing Page)"
   - Include all 5 learning outcomes from Phase 1
   - Add progress tracker for all 5 phases
   - Ensure all links are correct

2) **PATH: curricula/gcp-iac-fundamentals/curriculum.md** (Core Curriculum)  
   - Use CURRICULUM_TEMPLATE.md as foundation
   - Title should be: "Learning GCP Infrastructure as Code — Interactive Curriculum"
   - Fill in all 5 phases with detailed content from Phase 1 structure
   - Each phase needs: Goal, Core Ideas (3-5 bullets), AI Teacher prompts (2-3), Activity (no code), Reflect
   - Add your capstone options to Final Project section
   - Keep each phase ≤250 words

USABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CURRICULUM.MD:
- Add clear "How to Use This Curriculum" section at the top with numbered steps
- Format AI Teacher prompts as copy-paste ready with full context setup
- Use this format for AI Teacher prompts:
  ```
  ### Phase X Ask the AI Teacher
  
  **Copy this prompt to your AI assistant:**
  
  > You are an expert in [topic]. I'm learning about [phase topic] as part of a structured curriculum. 
  > 
  > Please help me understand: [question]
  > 
  > Provide a clear explanation with practical examples, and ask me a follow-up question to check my understanding.
  ```
- Add reflection templates users can fill out with specific prompts
- Include "What Good Looks Like" examples for activities
- Provide clear success criteria for each phase
- Add troubleshooting tips for common confusion points

3) **PATH: curricula/gcp-iac-fundamentals/companion-checklist.md** (Companion Checklist)
   - Use COMPANION_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md as foundation  
   - Title should be: "Learning GCP Infrastructure as Code — Companion Checklist"
   - Create quick prompts for each of the 5 phases
   - Include capstone deliverables section

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output each file as a separate markdown code block
- Prefix with exact PATH comment
- Example:
  <!-- PATH: curricula/gcp-iac-fundamentals/README.md -->
  ```markdown
  [file contents here]
  ```

MARKDOWN FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS (to prevent lint errors):
- Use only ONE H1 heading per file (the main title)
- Use H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections within phases
- Add blank lines before AND after all headings
- Add blank lines before AND after all lists
- Use proper H3 headings (###) instead of bold text (**text**) for subsections
- Make ALL headings unique - add phase numbers to subsection headings (e.g., "### Phase 1 Core Ideas", "### Phase 2 Core Ideas")
- Ensure consistent spacing throughout

QUALITY CHECKS:
- All internal links between files work correctly
- Front matter includes correct title, tags, and updated date
- Content is appropriate for beginner level
- Activities contain NO code - only descriptions/planning tasks
- Each phase builds logically on previous phases
- Markdown follows linting standards (no MD022, MD032, MD036, MD025 errors)
